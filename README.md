<h2>Pig Game</h2>

<p>A fun game written with javascript.</p>
<p>It is about competing your dice roll scores. The one who got 100 score first is the winner. You can roll dice until it scores number 1 or you can hold current score(your current score will be added to your total score unless it result a 1) and give a turn to the next player.</p>
<p>I reference the idea from the instructor of my javascript course and rewrite it with my own.</p>
<p>Hope u enjoy it.</p>
